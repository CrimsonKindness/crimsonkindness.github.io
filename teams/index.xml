      <description>Teams are the heart and soul of Crimson Kindness. Teams consist of fun activities engaging you and others in acts of kindness. Team Leaders will provide an activity at each meeting helping you to spread a little more kindness each time you go.
Teams meet every other week on Sunday-Thursday at 7:00 in the Ferguson Center on the 2nd floor. You can pick the team that works best for you, but you are welcome to participate each day you want!</description>
